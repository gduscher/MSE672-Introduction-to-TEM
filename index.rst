Welcome to
  
  
MSE672: Introduction to Transmission Electron Microscopy!
---------------------------------------------------------
A Course of the Materials Science & Engineering Department

at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville

by Gerd Duscher

Transmission electron microscopy is an essential tool for the characterization of materials especially of nano-structured and quantum materials. There are many different modes of operation and many different techniques available and the goal of this course is for the student be able to choose the best method for the problem at hand.

Scope of Course
---------------

The focus will be on the basics of

- Parts and Operation of a TEM
- Geometric Optics and Differences of TEM Modes
- Diffraction
- Imaging

In order to be in sync with the lab course we will only touch the parts of a TEM on a need to know basis. We will review the parts of a TEM after the imaging section.

I am using jupyter notebooks in my lectures and research and so here is a collection of notebooks for this course.

.. note::
   Please note, that there is NO PROGRAMMING required in this course.

   However, you are required to change input parameters and you are enouraged to play around with the notebooks


You will not have to install anything but you can use the notebooks in ``Google colab``. Here is a 
`link to a notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/github/gduscher/MSE672-Introduction-to-TEM/blob/main/Introduction/TestNotebook.ipynb>`_
 to try it out.

However, you will not have the full functionality of the jupyter notebooks on colab, and so I suggest to install anaconda on your laptop. You will need a fairly new version of anaconda and if you have an old version, the best way is to reinstall anaconda again.

The notebooks are all based on a library of functions called `pyTEMlib <https://github.com/pycroscopy/pyTEMlib>`_

You can `download all course notebooks <https://github.com/gduscher/MSE672-Introduction-to-TEM/archive/main.zi>`_
from github as a zip file.

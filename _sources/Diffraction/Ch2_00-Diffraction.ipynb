    "- Diffraction is the direct result of the interaction (with or without\n",
    "energy transfer) of electrons and matter.\n",
    "- Kinematic diffraction theory describes only the Bragg angles (the position of the Bragg reflections) but not the intensity in a real\n",
    "diffraction pattern.\n",
    "- Dynamic theory is responsible for the intensity variation of the Bragg reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diffraction and Imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "- To achieve an image from a diffraction pattern only a **Fourier Transformation** of parts of the diffraction pattern is needed.\n",
    "- Any image in a TEM can be described as **Fourier Filtering**, because we select the beams which form the images. The knowledge of which and how many diffracted beams contribute to the image formation is crucial.\n",
    "- Because the intensity of selected diffracted beams is necessary to calculate image intensities, dynamic diffraction theory is necessary.\n",

    "### Dynamic and Kinematic Theory\n",
    "- Kinematic Theory is based on a single scattering event per electron\n",
    "- Kinematic theory is used in neutron and X-ray diffraction almost exclusively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic theory incorporates multiple scattering events.\n",
    "- Dynamic theory results in *Rocking Curves* (oscillations) of intensities of diffracted beams with sample thickness.\n",
    "- Dynamic theory can analytically be solved only for the two beam case, strangely the basis for conventional TEM.\n",
